# Session Desktop

[Download at getsession.org](https://getsession.org/download)

## Summary

Session integrates directly with [Oxen Service Nodes](https://docs.oxen.io/about-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-nodes), which are a set of distributed, decentralized and Sybil resistant nodes. Service Nodes act as servers which store messages offline, and a set of nodes which allow for onion routing functionality obfuscating users IP Addresses. For a full understanding of how Session works, read the [Session Whitepaper](https://getsession.org/whitepaper).

## Verifying signatures

**Step 1:**

Add Jason's GPG key. Jason Rhinelander, a member of the [Session Technology Foundation](https://session.foundation/) and is the current signer for all Session Desktop releases. His GPG key can be found on his GitHub and other sources.

```sh
wget https://github.com/jagerman.gpg
gpg --import jagerman.gpg
```

**Step 2:**

Get the signed hashes for this release. `SESSION_VERSION` needs to be updated for the release you want to verify.

```sh
export SESSION_VERSION=1.15.0
wget https://github.com/session-foundation/session-desktop/releases/download/v$SESSION_VERSION/signature.asc
```

**Step 3:**

Verify the signature of the hashes of the files.

```sh
gpg --verify signature.asc 2>&1 |grep "Good signature from"
```

The command above should print "`Good signature from "Jason Rhinelander...`". If it does, the hashes are valid but we still have to make the sure the signed hashes match the downloaded files.

**Step 4:**

Make sure the two commands below return the same hash for the file you are checking. If they do, file is valid.
